Task2: Explain the difference between absolute and relative positioning.
Sol: 

1. Definition:
        Absolute Positioning : Elements are positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (if any).
        Relative Positioning : Elements are positioned relative to their normal position.

2. Effect on surrounding Elements:
        Absolute Positioning : Elements do not affect the position of the other Elements. They simply overlap with other elements.
        Relative Positioning : Elements maintain the space they would have occupied in the normal flow.

3. Normal Flow:
        Absolute Positioning : Elements are taken out of the normal flow of the document.
        Relative Positioning : Elements remain in the normal flow of the document.

4. Scroll behaviour:
        Absolute Positioning : Stays fixed to the viewport even when the page is scrolled.
        Relative Positioning : Scrolls with its containing block, which can include the viewport or a parent element with a specified height.

5. Syntax:
        Absolute Positioning :   
        .absolute-element{
            position: absolute;
        }
        Relative Positioning :   
        .relative-element{
            position: relative;
        }
